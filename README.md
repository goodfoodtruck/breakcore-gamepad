# Breakcore Gamepad

Just a five year old version of [yzhk's breakcore controller software](https://www.yzhkinstruments.com)

I just wanted to quickly discover how easy/hard it would be to use [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API). Turns out I ended up using [SBRK's React gamepad component](https://github.com/SBRK/react-gamepad)

- Sound effects and background were freely found online
